Welcome to my corner of the internet, a computer science and programming blog built around a simple
idea: the most rewarding way to learn something is to build it yourself.

My curiosity takes me all over the map, so I write about anything from distributed systems and
runtimes to graphics and ui. The common thread is a desire to understand these complex topics by
getting my hands dirty and starting from first principles.

This is also why you’ll see so much Zig here. Its ecosystem is still young and wonderfully unpaved,
which I find is a perfect motivator. Without a library for every problem, I have a great excuse to
figure things out and build what I need from the ground up.

The name for this little corner, `*anyopaque`, is a nod to that simple idea. it's a pointer to a
primitive type associated with type erased data — a blank slate if you will.

I'm so glad you stopped by. I hope you enjoy your stay.
